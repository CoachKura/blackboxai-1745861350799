# AI/ML Model for Personalized Training Using Jack Daniels Running Formula

## Overview
This AI/ML model is designed to generate personalized training plans and interval guidance based on the Jack Daniels running formula. It adapts over time by learning from the runner's historical performance data, enabling self-training and continuous improvement.

## Jack Daniels Running Formula
The Jack Daniels formula estimates training paces and intensities based on the runner's VO2 max and recent race performances. It defines training zones and paces for different types of workouts (easy runs, threshold runs, intervals, repetitions).

## Model Inputs
- Historical activity data: distance, pace, heart rate, cadence, stride length, GCT, vertical oscillation
- User profile: age, weight, fitness level, goals
- Recent race results or time trials
- Training history and adherence

## Model Outputs
- Personalized training paces for different workout types
- Interval training plans with target paces and durations
- Real-time pace recommendations during workouts
- Predictions of future performance improvements

## Model Architecture (Example)
A simple neural network or gradient boosting model can be used to map inputs to training paces and plans.

Example architecture:
- Input layer: features from user data and recent activities
- Hidden layers: fully connected layers with ReLU activation
- Output layer: predicted paces for various training zones

## Self-Training Mechanism
- Continuously collect new activity data from the user
- Periodically retrain or fine-tune the model with updated data
- Use transfer learning or incremental learning techniques to adapt without full retraining

## Sample Python Code (Using TensorFlow)

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def build_training_model(input_shape):
    model = models.Sequential()
    model.add(layers.InputLayer(input_shape=input_shape))
    model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
    model.add(layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'))
    model.add(layers.Dense(5, activation='linear'))  # Outputs: paces for 5 training zones
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

# Example usage
input_shape = (10,)  # Example feature vector length
model = build_training_model(input_shape)

# Dummy data for illustration
import numpy as np
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 5)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Predict training paces
sample_input = np.random.rand(1, 10)
predicted_paces = model.predict(sample_input)
print("Predicted training paces:", predicted_paces)
```

## Integration
- The model runs on the backend AI service
- Mobile app sends user data and receives training plans and pace recommendations
- Interval training voice guidance uses predicted paces for real-time coaching

This is a conceptual example. The actual model will be refined with domain expertise and real user data.
