# Detailed Plan for AI-Driven Mobile Fitness App

## Project Overview
Build a mobile fitness app similar to Strava and Garmin with advanced AI/ML-based personalized training using the Jack Daniels running formula. The app will provide interval training with real-time voice guidance and leverage phone sensors to capture advanced metrics such as cadence, stride length, ground contact time (GCT), and vertical oscillation.

## Key Features
- User registration, authentication, and profile management
- Activity tracking using phone GPS and sensors
- Advanced metrics calculation: cadence, stride length, GCT, vertical oscillation
- AI/ML personalized training plans based on Jack Daniels running formula
- Self-training AI that adapts based on user performance data
- Interval training with real-time voice guidance for pace and distance
- Integration with third-party platforms: Strava, Apple Health, Garmin Connect for data sync and import/export
- Social features: sharing activities, leaderboards, challenges (optional future phase)
- Analytics dashboard for performance insights
- Notifications and reminders for training sessions

## Technology Stack

### Mobile App
- Framework: React Native or Flutter (cross-platform for iOS and Android)
- Language: JavaScript/TypeScript (React Native) or Dart (Flutter)
- Sensor integration: Native modules or plugins for accessing phone sensors (accelerometer, GPS)
- Voice guidance: Text-to-Speech (TTS) APIs (e.g., Google Text-to-Speech, iOS AVSpeechSynthesizer)

### Backend
- Framework: Node.js with Express or Python with FastAPI/Django REST Framework
- Database: PostgreSQL for relational data, TimescaleDB extension for time-series data (optional)
- AI/ML services: Python-based microservices using TensorFlow/PyTorch for model training and inference
- Authentication: JWT-based or OAuth 2.0
- Hosting: Cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) or managed services (Heroku, Vercel)

### AI/ML
- Model based on Jack Daniels running formula for training plan generation
- Self-training mechanism using user activity data to refine predictions
- Interval training pace and distance prediction with voice guidance triggers
- Data preprocessing pipelines for sensor data and activity logs

## Data Models
- User: profile, preferences, authentication credentials
- Activity: GPS route, timestamps, sensor metrics (cadence, stride length, GCT, vertical oscillation)
- Training Plan: AI-generated plans, intervals, targets
- Performance Metrics: historical data for AI training and analytics

## API Design
- User endpoints: register, login, profile update
- Activity endpoints: upload, fetch, delete activities
- Training endpoints: get personalized plans, update progress
- AI endpoints: interval guidance, pace recommendations
- Analytics endpoints: fetch performance summaries

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, modern, and responsive design using Tailwind CSS for web components or native UI frameworks
- Real-time display of metrics during activity
- Voice guidance controls and feedback
- Training plan overview and progress tracking
- Easy navigation and accessibility features

## Development Phases
1. MVP: User auth, basic activity tracking, display GPS route
2. Advanced metrics integration (cadence, stride length, GCT, vertical oscillation)
3. AI/ML training plan generation and interval training with voice guidance
4. Self-training AI improvements and analytics dashboard
5. Social features and notifications

## Deployment and Scaling
- Use containerization (Docker) for backend and AI services
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Scalable cloud infrastructure with load balancing and database backups
